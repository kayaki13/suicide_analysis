# suicide_analysis

   By looking at datasets reflecting global suicidal situations from 1980s to 2010s, this
project aims to detangle and analyze the information and conclusion from raw data, and find
potential macroscopic casualties or relations with other elements such as weather, war,
pandemics, economical incidents, etc.
The project is divided into 2 parts, the first part focuses on data analysis. I plan to
compare data between regions, generations, genders, ages, etc., and visualize their tendencies
along the timeline and map them according to their locations.
The second part of the project focuses on prediction. Based on tendencies found in the
previous part, we can build machine learning models and therefore predict suicidal situations in
certain areas in the future. We can split the dataset and utilize a part as a training dataset, and
another part as a validation set. The final prediction could also be visualized and mapped to
locations.
